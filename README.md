# Useless Website Pixel App
The goal of this app was to make a useless website that would switch from one pixel image to another.
The goal has changed to first allow the user to upload a pixel image and see the image split pixel by pixel
Then the image will change to a new one based on a button click

- a fxn was made to get the rgb data into an array

To Do:
